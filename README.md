# Substitution-Cipher

# Input

The only piece of information the script needs is the string you want to encrypt. There should be no numbers or special characters, just letters from the english alphabet.
The script automatically removes any spaces and converts uppercase letters to lowercase.

# Output

There are two pieces of output. The first piece is the string that was entered in the beginning but now encrypted. Due to the fact that substitution cipher produces different
keys everytime it is used, the script will automatically make a seperate file called SubCipherKey.txt. This file contains the random key that was used to encrypt the inputted
string.
